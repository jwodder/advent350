1	A large cloud of green smoke appears in front of you.  It clears away
1	to reveal a tall wizard, clothed in grey.  He fixes you with a steely
1	glare and declares, "This adventure has lasted too long."  With that
1	he makes a single pass over you with his hands, and everything around
1	you fades away into a grey nothingness.
2	Even wizards have to wait longer than that!
