Outline of wizard authentication:
 - You are asked whether you are a wizard.  Answer "Yes".
 - You are asked to say the magic word.  Enter its current value as stored in
   the magic file.
 - The game prints out:

    That is not what I thought it was.  Do you know what I thought it was?

 - Answer "No".
 - The game will print out a random five-letter "word".
 - Perform a number of mathematical operations on this word and enter the
   result:  (This is the part that frawd(6) automates.)
  - Take the current time (specifically, the time at which you expect to enter
    the result) as an hour `h' from 0 through 23 and a minute `m' from 0
    through 59.  Calculate h * 100 + m, change the last digit to a zero, and
    call this number `t'.
  - Let the "value" of a letter be a number from 1 through 26 based on its
    position in the alphabet (i.e., A has value 1, B has value 2, C has value
    3, etc.).
  - For `i' from 1 through 5:
   - Take the magnitude of the difference between the value of the i-th letter
     in the word the game gave you and the value of the letter immediately
     after that.  (If i=5, take the difference between the values of the last &
     first letters of the word.)
   - Multiply this number by the i-th digit of the magic number (as stored in
     the magic file), counting from the *end* of the number (i.e., the
     ones-place is the first digit, the tens-place is the second, the
     hundredths-place is the third, etc.).
   - Add to this the i-th digit of `t', again counting from the *end* of the
     number.
   - Take the remainder from dividing this number by 26.
   - Add 1.
   - The result is the value of the i-th letter in the word with which to
     respond to the game.
 - The game will now recognize you as a wizard.
 - The default magic word is "DWARF", and the default magic number is 11111.
