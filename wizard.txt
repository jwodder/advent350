WIZARD AUTHENTICATION
You will need to know the current magic word (default value "DWARF") and the
current magic number (default value 11111) as they are currently stored in the
magic file (or their default values if there is no magic file).

GAME: Are you a wizard?
ANSWER: Yes
GAME: Prove it!  Say the magic word!
[Enter the magic word.]
GAME: That is not what I thought it was.  Do you know what I thought it was?
ANSWER: No

The game will now print out a random five-letter "word."  You must perform a
series of mathematical operations on it to produce another five-letter word to
give in response (This is the part that frawd(6) automates).

 - Take the current time (specifically, the time at which you expect to enter
   the result) as an hour `h' from 0 through 23 and a minute `m' from 0 through
   59.  Calculate h * 100 + m, change the last digit to a zero, and call this
   number `t'.  For this port of Adventure, the game uses the values returned
   by the localtime(3) function, which should correspond to your current
   timezone settings.  Other ports may vary; consult your wizard if frustration
   lasts longer than four hours.
 - The "value" of a letter is here defined to be a number from 1 through 26
   corresponding to the letter's position in the alphabet (i.e., A has value 1,
   B has value 2, C has value 3, etc.).
 - For `i' from 1 through 5:
  - Take the magnitude of the difference between the value of the i-th letter
    in the word the game gave you and the value of the letter immediately after
    that.  (If i=5, take the difference between the values of the last & first
    letters of the word.)
  - Multiply this number by the i-th digit of the magic number, counting from
    the *end* of the number (i.e., the ones-place is the first digit, the
    tens-place is the second, the hundredths-place is the third, etc.).
  - Add the i-th digit of `t', again counting from the *end* of the number.
  - Divide by 26, take the remainder, and add 1 to it.
  - The result is the value of the i-th letter of the reply.

Once you enter the new word, the game will recognize you as a wizard:
GAME: Oh dear, you really *are* a wizard!  Sorry to have bothered you . . .
