 "sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted\n"
 "formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky\n"
 "light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep\n"
 "gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to\n"
 "have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire\n"
 "crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the\n"
 "gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To\n"

 "He is carrying a large chest.  \"Shiver me timbers!\" he cries, \"I've\n"
