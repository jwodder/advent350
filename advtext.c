 "formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky\n"
 "light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep\n"
 "gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to\n"
 "have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire\n"
 "crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the\n"

 "On what?\n",

 /* 156 */
 "Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time\n"
 "you come to it.  To get the full description, say \"look\".\n",

 /* 157 */
 "Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as\n"
 "that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.\n",

 /* 158 */
 "The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it\n"
 "back, declaring, \"Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough.\"\n",

 /* 159 */
 "The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.\n",

 /* 160 */
 "The troll refuses to let you cross.\n",

 /* 161 */
 "There is no longer any way across the chasm.\n",

 /* 162 */
 "Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the\n"
 "weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You\n"
 "scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you\n"
 "stumble back and fall into the chasm.\n",

 /* 163 */
 "The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and\n"
 "scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.\n",

 /* 164 */
 "The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it.\n",

 /* 165 */
 "With what?  Your bare hands?  Against *HIS* bear hands??\n",

 /* 166 */
 "The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.\n",

 /* 167 */
 "For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!\n",

 /* 168 */
 "The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems to calm\n"
 "down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.\n",

 /* 169 */
 "The bear is still chained to the wall.\n",

 /* 170 */
 "The chain is still locked.\n",

 /* 171 */
 "The chain is now unlocked.\n",

 /* 172 */
 "The chain is now locked.\n",

 /* 173 */
 "There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.\n",

 /* 174 */
 "There is nothing here to eat.\n",

 /* 175 */
 "Do you want the hint?\n",

 /* 176 */
 "Do you need help getting out of the maze?\n",

 /* 177 */
 "You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.\n",

 /* 178 */
 "Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?\n",

 /* 179 */
 "There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about\n"
 "falling into a pit.  None of the objects available is immediately\n"
 "useful in discovering the secret.\n",

 /* 180 */
 "Do you need help getting out of here?\n",

 /* 181 */
 "Don't go west.\n",

 /* 182 */
 "Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.\n",

 /* 183 */
 "Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless\n"
 "you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending\n"
 "machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.\n",

 /* 184 */
 "Your lamp has run out of power.\n",

 /* 185 */
 "There's not much point in wandering around out here, and you can't\n"
 "explore the cave without a lamp.  So let's just call it a day.\n",

 /* 186 */
 "There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you\n"
 "turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.\n"
 "He is carrying a large chest.  \"Shiver me timbers!\" he cries, \"I've\n"
 "been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!\"\n"
 "With that, he vanishes into the gloom.\n",

 /* 187 */
 "Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for those batteries.\n",

 /* 188 */
 "Your lamp is getting dim.  I'm taking the liberty of replacing the\n"
 "batteries.\n",

 /* 189 */
 "Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.  You'd\n"
 "best start wrapping this up.\n",

 /* 190 */
 "I'm afraid the magazine is written in dwarvish.\n",

 /* 191 */
 "\"This is not the maze where the pirate leaves his treasure chest.\"\n",

 /* 192 */
 "Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to\n"
 "read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?\n",

 /* 193 */
 "It says, \"There is something strange about this place, such that one\n"
 "of the words I've always known now has a new effect.\"\n",

 /* 194 */
 "It says the same thing it did before.\n",

 /* 195 */
 "I'm afraid I don't understand.\n",

 /* 196 */
 "\"Congratulations on bringing light into the dark-room!\"\n",

 /* 197 */
 "You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a\n"
 "myriad tiny fragments.\n",

 /* 198 */
 "You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.\n",

 /* 199 */
 "You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at\n"
 "you, curses, and grabs for his axe.\n",

 /* 200 */
 "Is this acceptable?\n",

 /* 201 */
 "There's no point in suspending a demonstration game.\n"
