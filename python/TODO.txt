- Test everything!
- Get rid of as many global variables as possible
- Try to completely rewrite the system for keeping track of object locations
 - Add a constant for -1 (the location of your inventory)?
- Make all the magic functions into methods of Magic?
- Remove fields that are always the same when saved (gaveup, foobar, closing?,
  closed, ???) from `Game` (or just from its pickling method?)
- Ensure the code works in both Python 2 and Python 3
 - Make all strings Unicode
- If the user enters "save" without a filename while playing a restored game,
  save the game to the same path that it was restored from?
- Add command-line options for specifying the default save file path, whether
  to use magic, and whether to use the original RNG
- Change the `Limits` values to the actual quantities rather than the upper
  limits imposed by the original Fortran?
- Add docstrings
- Add error handling for when restoring a saved game fails
- When a magic file is specified on the command line, `maint` should save to it
  instead of the default path
