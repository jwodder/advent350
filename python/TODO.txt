- Test everything!
- Get rid of as many global variables as possible
 - Make them all attributes of Adventure and/or Game?
- Try to completely rewrite the system for keeping track of object locations

- Use constants in place of as many magic numbers as possible/reasonable
- Add an option for using the original RNG with a specified seed/datime for the
  purposes of reproducibility/testing?
