- Test everything!
- Get rid of as many global variables as possible
 - Make them all attributes of Adventure and/or Game?
- Remove fields that are always the same when saved (gaveup, foobar, ???) from
  `Game` (or just from its pickling method?)
- Ensure the code works in both Python 2 and Python 3
- Get the code to pass pylint
- If the user enters "save" without a filename while playing a restored game,
  save the game to the same path that it was restored from?
- Add a command-line option for specifying the default save file path
- Add docstrings
- Use constants in place of as many magic numbers as possible/reasonable
- Merge the Adventure and Game classes together?
