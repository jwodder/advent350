- Use constants for `cond` values (and eliminate `bitset`?)
- Get rid of as many global variables as possible
 - Make `blklin` into a keyword argument of the functions that use it
- Try to completely rewrite the system for keeping track of object locations
 - Add a constant for -1 (the location of your inventory)?
- Combine `yes()` and `yesm()` (with `yesx()`?)
- Make all the magic functions into methods of Magic?
- Remove fields that are always the same when saved (gaveup, foobar, closing?,
  closed, ???) from `Game` (or just from its pickling method?)
- Ensure the code works in both Python 2 and Python 3
 - Make all strings Unicode
- If the user enters "save" without a filename while playing a restored game,
  save the game to the same path that it was restored from?
- Make the arrays be properly zero-based?
- Add command-line options & arguments for specifying the location of the data
  file, the location of the magic file, the default save file path, whether to
  use magic, and whether to use the original RNG
