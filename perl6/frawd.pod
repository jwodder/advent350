=head1 NAME

B<frawd> - pass wizard authentication in I<The Colossal Cave Adventure>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<frawd> [B<-m> I<magic number>] [B<-H> I<hour>] [B<-M> I<minute>] I<word>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Frawd> ("dwarf" spelled backwards) can be used to automatically determine the
second magic word needed for wizard authentication in I<The Colossal Cave
Adventure>.  Specifically, it is used with versions of I<Adventure> which (a)
retain the cave hours restrictions and the wizard/maintenance mode of the
original 350-point version and (b) implement wizard authentication in the exact
same way that it is done in the original Fortran.  There are very few such
versions.

B<Frawd> takes as an argument the five-letter word randomly generated by
I<Adventure> as part of wizard authentication, and it prints out the proper
five-letter word to enter in response.  The rest of wizard authentication is
left as an exercise to the spelunker.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-m> I<magic number>

Specifies the value of the magic number currently in effect in I<Adventure>.
The default value, for both I<Adventure> and B<frawd>, is 11111.
I<Adventure>'s magic number can be changed via wizard/maintenance mode.  If you
don't know the magic number, B<frawd> will not give you the right answer.

=item B<-H> I<hour>

Specifies the hour (in 24-hour format) of the time when B<frawd>'s answer will
be supplied to I<Adventure>.  The default is the current hour.

=item B<-M> I<minute>

Specifies the minutes past the hour of the time when B<frawd>'s answer will be
supplied to I<Adventure>.  The default is the current time.  Note that the last
digit of the time is ignored, so you only need to worry about human response
time when that digit is '9'.
