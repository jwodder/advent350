=head1 NAME

B<advent350> - I<The Colossal Cave Adventure>, 350 point version

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<advent350> [I<gamefile>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<The Colossal Cave Adventure> is a classic of computer gaming and the
progenitor of the text adventure and interactive fiction genres.  In it, you
explore Colossal Cave, finding treasures, solving fiendish puzzles, and trying
not to get killed by those dwarves.

Game commands consist of one or two words and are (mostly) self-evident, such
as "C<take lamp>" or "C<north>."  Only the first five letters of the first two
words per input line are considered, and all commands are case-insensitive.

This port of the original 350-point version of I<Adventure> is intended to be
as true to the original as is sane; the biggest differences are that game data
is no longer saved by suspending the program and saving its core image, and, of
course, that not all of the letters are upper-case.  If so configured at
compile time, the game will even include the "magic" features of the original
(i.e., forced delays before restarting a saved game and "prime time" hours
during which the game cannot be normally played) which are often omitted from
ports, due partially to being unnecessary & annoying on modern computers.

=head1 SAVING AND RESTORING

Games can be saved & restored with the commands C<save> (or C<pause> or
C<suspend>) and C<restore> (or C<load> or C<restart> or C<resume>).  These
commands take the name of the save file as an optional argument; if it is not
given, the game is written to or read from F<$HOME/.adventure>.  A saved game
may also be restored directly by supplying the filename on the command line.

=head1 FILES

=over

=item F<$HOME/.adventure>

Games are saved to and read from this file by default when no filename is given
to the C<save> or C<restore> command.

=item F</usr/games/lib/advmagic>

This is the default path which the current "magic" settings are read from and
written to.  It is only used if ADVMAGIC was defined at compile time.

=back

=head1 BUGS

I suspect that there may still be some lingering typos in the code or game
text somewhere.  Let me know if you find any.

The save files and magic file are completely vulnerable to editing by malicious
players -- but you'd have to be pretty pathetic to want to edit them
dishonestly in the first place.

Cave "prime time" hours and game restoration delays can be circumvented by
changing the time zone (or just changing the system time).

Due to the way the command parser works, save file names may not contain
spaces, and if the C<save>/C<restore> command is over MAX_INPUT_LENGTH (default
80) characters long, any characters after that point are cut off.

Messages about saving your "core image" are still printed when saving your game
(if ADVMAGIC was defined at compile time) and after changing the "magic"
values, despite the fact that these messages are now irrelevant and misleading.
