- Make the arrays be properly zero-based
- If the user enters "save" without a filename while playing a restored game,
  should the game be saved to the same path that it was restored from?
- Rewrite the README file to contain instructions on configuration, building,
  installation, and the potential security hole of the magic file
 - Somewhere include instructions for how to pass wizard authentication (along
   with general instructions for magic/maintenance mode?)
 - Add a note about the save files & magic file being completely vulnerable to
   editing
- Add a manpage for frawd
- Add a licensing (or lack thereof) notice?
- Once this port is completely finished, submit it to the Interactive Fiction
  Archive.
- Consider adding a configuration option to enable an "old-tymey" interface in
  which all output lines begin with a single space and there is no "> " input
  prompt (lowercase letters will still be used, though).
