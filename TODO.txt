- Make the arrays be properly zero-based
- If the user enters "save" without a filename while playing a restored game,
  should the game be saved to the same path that it was restored from?
- Check everything to make sure it works!
- Reorganize the partitioning of functions into files into something sane
- In maint(), the prompts for several integral values say that entering a null
  line will leave the value unchanged, yet C's scanf() doesn't easily allow for
  that.  Fix this.
- Prevent restoring a saved game while playing a demo game.
- Check the return values of all of the fread/fwrite calls in vsuspend(),
  vresume(), maint(), and poof() for failure
- Somehow deal with the historical messages about saving your "core image" when
  suspending a game or finishing maintenance mode in the magic version
