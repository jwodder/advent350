- Finish translating the Perl 6 code into C
 - Translate the getin() function
 - Translate the portions of maint() and poof() for reading & writing the magic
   values to/from a file
- Translate the original RAN() function to C
- Write a Makefile
- Add a header file containing declarations for all of the functions & global
  variables
- Write a Perl 6 program to convert the old-format data file(s) into a C source
  file containing arrays of strings
- Make the arrays be properly zero-based
- If the user enters "save" without a filename while playing a restored game,
  save the game to the same path that it was restored from?
- Check everything to make sure it works!
- Reorganize the partitioning of functions into files into something sane
- Store all of the user data variables in a single struct for ease of reading &
  writing and so that bit fields can be used?
- In maint(), the prompts for several integral values say that entering a null
  line will leave the value unchanged, yet C's scanf() doesn't easily allow for
  that.  Fix this.
