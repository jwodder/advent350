- Make the arrays be properly zero-based
- If the user enters "save" without a filename while playing a restored game,
  should the game be saved to the same path that it was restored from?
- Rewrite the README file to contain instructions on configuration, building,
  installation, and the potential security hole of the magic file
 - Add a note about the save files & magic file being completely vulnerable to
   editing
- Create a file named "wizard.txt" containing instructions for how to pass
  wizard authentication, along with general instructions for magic/maintenance
  mode
- Add a licensing (or lack thereof) notice
- Once this port is completely finished, submit it to the Interactive Fiction
  Archive.
- Consider adding a configuration option to enable an "old-tymey" interface in
  which all output lines begin with a single space and there is no "> " input
  prompt (lowercase letters will still be used, though).
- Store the game state (and the "magic" state) in a struct so that it can be
  saved & restored in one fell swoop and also be easily backed up before
  restoring in case something goes wrong
- Improve the storage of the travel table
- Deal with all of the bugs listed in the manpage
