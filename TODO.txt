- Complete the instructions in the README file for configuring, building, and
  installing the game
 - Add a note about the save files & magic file being completely vulnerable to
   editing (and the magic file to viewing)
- Create a file named "wizard.txt" containing instructions for how to pass
  wizard authentication along with general instructions for magic/maintenance
  mode
- Add a licensing (or lack thereof) notice
- Once this port is completely finished, submit it to the Interactive Fiction
  Archive.
- Add actual comments to the code for anyone else who ever looks at it
- Deal with all of the bugs listed in the manpage
- Make the arrays be properly zero-based
- Improve the storage of the travel table
- If the user enters "save" without a filename while playing a restored game,
  should the game be saved to the same path that it was restored from?
- Consider adding a compile-time configuration option to enable an "old-tymey"
  interface in which all output lines begin with a single space and there is no
  "> " input prompt (lowercase letters will still be used, though).
- Consider adding a compile-time option for setting the euid and/or egid back
  to its/their real values so that the binary can have its setuid/setgid flag
  set to protect the magic file from outsiders while avoiding security problems
  with creating save files
- When setting the name of the next holiday, should the game use the first 20
  characters of the whole line or just of the first word?
