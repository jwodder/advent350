- Implement readInt() and readBool()
- Add the appropriate error checking to vsuspend() & vresume()
 - Make the magic version of vresume() recognize a missing $saved or $savet
   value correctly (possibly using a "try" block?)
- Split advent350.pl6 into two versions: one with magic, one without
- For the magic version, add a way to save changes made in maintenance mode
- Translate the Perl 6 to C
 - Use preprocessor directives to configure:
  - whether to include magic
  - whether to use C's rand() or the original Fortran's RAN() for random number
    generation
- Write a script for converting advent350.pl6 from its "ideal" form into one
  that works on the current version of Rakudo
- Make the arrays be properly zero-based
- Write a manpage using Perl 6 POD
- Write a Perl 6 program for solving the second part of wizard authentication
  automatically
- If the user enters "save" without a filename while playing a restored game,
  save the game to the same path that it was restored from?
- Check everything to make sure it works!
- Reorder the function definitions so that they are always declared before they
  are used.
