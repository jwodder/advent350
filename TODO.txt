- Finish translating the original Fortran to Perl 6
- Translate the Perl 6 to C
 - Use preprocessor directives to configure:
  - whether to include magic
  - (possibly) whether to include the second part of wizard authentication
  - whether to use C's rand() or the original Fortran's RAN() for random number
    generation
- Write a script for converting advent350.pl6 from its "ideal" form into one
  that works on the current version of Rakudo
- Split advent350.pl6 into two versions: one with magic, one without
- Add a README explaining what I'm doing and/or why I'm doing it, along with
  links to the IF Archive's downloads of the original Fortran source and the
  BDS C source
- Add "save" and "restore"/"restart"/"resume"/"load" (2032) commands
- For the magic version, add a way to save changes made in maintenance mode
  (see how the NetBSD version does it)
- Add transcripts?
- Make the arrays be properly zero-based
- Upload the repository to GitHub with the name "advent350" (description: "Yet
  another port of the Colossal Cave Adventure")
- Deal with what should happen if the user enters an empty line.
- Write a manpage (using Perl 6 POD?)
