problems with the BDS C port of Adventure:
 - no hints system
 - no score rankings
 - The odds of successfully killing a dwarf are 33% instead of 2 out of 3.
 - Dwarves move at random [[elaborate]] and got a chance to attack you every
   single turn, even if you're just picking up the axe in the middle of battle.
