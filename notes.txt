Important coding related notes from the original Fortran:
 - Each "from-location" gets a contiguous section of the "TRAVEL" array.  Each
   entry in TRAVEL is NEWLOC*1000 [NEWLOC is the second-column value from
   section 3] + KEYWORD (from section 4, motion verbs), and is negated if this
   is the last entry for this location.  KEY(N) is the index in TRAVEL of the
   first option at location N.
 - An object number N>100 at a location is the second-location instance of
   object N-100.
 - [The current hours when the cave is open for adventuring] is stored in
   WKDAY, WKEND, and HOLID, where bit SHIFT(1,N) is on iff the hour from N:00
   to N:59 is "prime time" (cave closed).  WKDAY is for weekdays, WKEND for
   weekends, HOLID for holidays.  Next holiday is from HBEGIN to HEND.
